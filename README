Sample client application for using the SC_Listener library

* It requires the frequency modifications here: git://github.com/jkells/sc_listener.git

* If you comment out a few lines it should also work with the original library here: http://github.com/stephencelis/sc_listener

Just put the SC_Listener.m/h files in the root directory of the project.
